    storyTitle: "Our Founding Story",
    storyText1: "NovaRoof Solutions was born from a common frustration: the overwhelming and often uncertain process of finding a qualified roofing contractor. Our founders, a group of homeowners and technology enthusiasts, grew tired of watching friends and family navigate a broken system. They saw the stress of chasing down quotes, the confusion of verifying licenses, and the anxiety of dealing with unreliable companies, especially after a storm when time is critical.",
    storyText2: "The 'aha' moment came after a major hailstorm. While some neighbors received quality repairs, others were left with shoddy work and unresolved insurance claims. The only difference was the quality of their contractor. We knew technology could solve this problem. We are not roofers—we are problem solvers. We dedicated ourselves to building a smart, data-driven platform that vets and partners with only the best local roofing companies across the nation. Our mission is to replace guesswork with certainty.",
